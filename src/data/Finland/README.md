# SwedenCOVIDTree

The Sweden COVID-19 tree example showcases how to implement a simple custom filesystem and a pre-constructed tree. It visualizes the entire population of Sweden, with directories for the regional hierarchy and region population split into buckets of 10, grouped in buckets of 1000, and a file per person.
